# Fullstack React and Go ToDo App 

I learn Go by practice with a fullstack project that I follow through tutorials on youtube. The tutorials are from freeCodeCamp and Burak Orkmez as a tutor from As a Programmer YouTube Channel. Hand-on experience in fulstack development like this is important to get a better understanding of a fullstack react and golang. For those who are curious, you can try this practice/exercise. Here are the Resources for your reference:
